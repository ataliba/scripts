In this dir I put some scripts to use on access of your resources on SDF ( Super Dimensional Fortress ) - http://sdf.org.

I test all of this scripts on my Fedora, and if you test this scripts on another operating systems or linux distros and see any bugs, open a request on GitHub.
I will try to process your request and put a new version on this dir.
